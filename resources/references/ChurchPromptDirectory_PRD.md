## Problem Statement

Church leaders and staff need effective AI prompts for their daily ministry work, but creating quality prompts from scratch is time-consuming. There's no centralized, church-focused resource where ministry professionals can discover, share, and learn from proven AI prompts tailored to their unique needs across sermon preparation, pastoral care, administration, and other church activities.

## Jobs to be Done

**When** a church leader needs to accomplish a ministry task using AI
**I want to** quickly find proven, church-specific prompts that others have successfully used
**So I can** save time, learn effective prompt patterns, and focus on ministry rather than prompt engineering

**When** I discover a useful AI prompt for church work
**I want to** share it with the broader church community
**So I can** help other ministry leaders work more effectively and contribute to collective knowledge

**When** I'm new to using AI in ministry
**I want to** explore categorized prompts and see what others find valuable
**So I can** learn best practices and standardize my AI workflows

## Out of Scope (Deferred for Future Versions)

### Features Deferred
- **User ratings and reviews for prompts** - Basic usage analytics sufficient for MVP. Add when users request quality feedback mechanisms or we have 500+ prompts.
- **Advanced analytics dashboard** - Basic usage counts cover current needs. Build detailed analytics when we have 6+ months of usage data or users request custom reports.
- **Prompt versioning and history** - Edit and re-approval workflow handles current needs. Add version control when users report needing to track prompt evolution or revert changes.
- **Social features (comments, discussions)** - Focus on core directory functionality first. Add community features when we have 1,000+ active users or users request collaboration tools.
- **API access for third-party integrations** - Web interface sufficient for MVP. Provide API when external tools request integration or we have 5+ integration requests.
- **Multi-language support** - English-only for MVP. Add internationalization when 20%+ of traffic comes from non-English regions.
- **Prompt collections/bundles** - Individual prompts meet current needs. Add collections when users report organizing 50+ saved prompts or request curated sets.
- **AI-powered prompt suggestions** - Manual search and browse adequate for MVP. Add AI recommendations when catalog exceeds 500 prompts or users report discovery challenges.

### Technical Complexity Deferred
- **Real-time collaboration features** - Async submission and approval sufficient for current workflow. Add real-time updates when multiple admins report conflicts or we have 10+ concurrent moderators.
- **Advanced search with NLP** - Basic full-text search adequate for less than 1,000 prompts. Add semantic search when catalog exceeds 2,000 prompts or search satisfaction drops below 70%.
- **CDN for global performance** - Single-region deployment handles current user base. Add CDN when 30%+ of users are international or page load times exceed 3 seconds.
- **Elasticsearch for search** - Database full-text search sufficient for less than 1,000 prompts. Add Elasticsearch when catalog exceeds 5,000 prompts or search latency exceeds 1 second.
- **Microservices architecture** - Monolith appropriate for current team size and deployment cadence. Split services when we have multiple teams deploying independently or clear service boundaries emerge.
